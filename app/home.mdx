# hi thereðŸ‘‹

I'm Yizhou Wang (çŽ‹ä¸€å·ž), a forth-year undergraduate student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/).
and also a full-stack developer and red-teaming enthusiast.

Currently, I'm looking for full-time SDE position and applying to graduate school. My research interests include
computer network, systems and information security.

At Northeastern, I have had the pleasure of working with and leading some talented individuals on a variety of projects.
Listing a few of them below:
